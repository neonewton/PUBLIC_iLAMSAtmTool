Knowledge Base: Operating an Air Conditioner (AC)
1. What an Air Conditioner (AC) Does

An air conditioner:

Removes heat from indoor air

Releases heat outside

Circulates cooled air back into the room

Core purpose:

Maintain a comfortable indoor temperature

Reduce humidity in enclosed spaces

2. Main Components of an AC System

Indoor Unit

Evaporator coil

Air filter

Fan (blower)

Outdoor Unit

Compressor

Condenser coil

Fan

Refrigerant

A chemical fluid that transfers heat

[ Room Air ]
     |
     v
[ Evaporator ] ---> Heat absorbed
     |
     v
[ Compressor ] ---> Pressure increased
     |
     v
[ Condenser ] ---> Heat released outside

3. Basic AC Operating Modes

Cool

Lowers room temperature

Most commonly used mode

Dry

Reduces humidity

Minimal cooling effect

Fan

Circulates air without cooling

Auto

AC decides cooling based on set temperature

4. Temperature Settings and Their Impact

Recommended temperature range:

24°C – 26°C

Lower temperature settings:

Increase power consumption

Increase compressor workload

Higher temperature settings:

Reduce energy usage

Less stress on the system

5. Airflow and Fan Speed

Fan speed controls:

How fast air is circulated

Does NOT directly control cooling strength

General guidance:

High fan speed → faster air circulation

Low fan speed → quieter operation

6. Proper AC Startup Procedure

Before turning on:

Ensure doors and windows are closed

Remove obstructions from air vents

Startup steps:

Turn on AC

Select Cool mode

Set temperature (e.g. 25°C)

Set fan speed as needed

7. Proper AC Shutdown Procedure

Before turning off:

Increase temperature slightly (optional)

Let AC run briefly to stabilize

Shutdown steps:

Turn off AC using remote or switch

Avoid cutting power immediately from the main switch

8. Importance of Air Filters

Air filters:

Trap dust and particles

Protect internal components

Improve air quality

Poor filter condition can cause:

Reduced cooling efficiency

Increased power consumption

Ice buildup on coils

9. Basic Maintenance Tasks (User-Level)

Clean air filters:

Frequency: every 2–4 weeks (depending on usage)

Visual checks:

No water leaking indoors

Outdoor unit not blocked

What users should NOT do:

Open sealed components

Handle refrigerant

Modify wiring

10. Common Operational Issues

AC not cold:

Filter may be dirty

Temperature set too high

Room too large for unit capacity

Water dripping indoors:

Drainage may be blocked

Filter may be dirty

Unusual noise:

Loose parts

Obstruction in airflow

11. Energy Efficiency Best Practices

Keep doors and windows closed

Use curtains or blinds during daytime

Avoid frequent ON/OFF cycles

Clean filters regularly

12. Safety Considerations

Do not operate with exposed wiring

Do not spray water directly onto indoor unit

Turn off power before cleaning filters

13. What This Knowledge Base Does NOT Cover

Refrigerant refilling procedures

Electrical repairs

Internal component replacement

Brand-specific configurations

14. When to Escalate to a Technician

AC does not turn on

Persistent water leakage

Burning smell

Repeated circuit breaker trips

15. Learning Mindset (For Junior Administrators)

Observe system behaviour before changing settings

Understand cause-effect relationships

Document recurring issues

Ask:

What changed before the issue started?

Is this a usage issue or a system issue?
